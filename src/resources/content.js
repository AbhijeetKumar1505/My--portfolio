        Hi, I'm Abhijeet Kumar — a passionate Data Science undergraduate at IIT Madras, specializing in backend development, automation, and data-driven product strategy. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Django, and modern data tools, I build robust, scalable solutions that prioritize performance and user experience. As the Co-Founder & Marketing Strategist at NexusTycoon.com, I've driven business growth through data analytics, process automation, and targeted marketing strategies. I also serve as Secretary of Rampage Esports Club, where I manage operations, events, and partnerships. Beyond technical skills, I'm deeply committed to community-building and mentorship, having worked with dynamic teams and online communities to foster collaboration and personal development. My work is grounded in clear communication, leadership, and a continuous learning mindset.
